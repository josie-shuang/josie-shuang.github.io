#Introduction
intro_text: I am a second-year PhD student majoring in Clinical Psychology at Penn State University, State College. I am currently working with <a href="http://psych.la.psu.edu/directory/sjw42">Dr. Stephen Wilson</a> on a project that examines the impacts of contextual information on the neural and subjective reactivity to food and non-food reward cues in indivivduals with eating regulatory difficulties. Our goal is to identify the neural markers that predict motivational dysfunctions and over-eating behaviors in an obesogenic environment replete with energy-dense, highly palatable food. We expect that these results will become one important contribution to the long line of the research in our lab that is aimed at developing a better understanding of the cognitive, affective, and motivational factors for addiction and overconsumption behaviors. <br/><br/> Outside of research, I am also trained and practice clinical assessment, diagnosis, and psychotherapy at the <a href="http://psych.la.psu.edu/psychological-clinic">Penn State Psychological Clinic</a>. <br/><br/> In my spare time, I enjoy running, reading, and writing my detective novel :)
